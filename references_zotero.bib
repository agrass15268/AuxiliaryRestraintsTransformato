Using the latest version of the general assisted model building with energy refinement (AMBER) force field for ligand model parameters and the Bennett acceptance ratio for computing free-energy differences, we obtained an excellent linear fit between the calculated and experimental binding free energies. The rms error from a linear fit is

In comparison with a previous study of the binding energies of these same eight ligand complexes, these results suggest that the use of improved model parameters can lead to more predictive binding estimates, and that these estimates can be obtained with significantly less computer time than previously thought. These findings make such direct methods more attractive for use in rational drug design.},

	abstract = {Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of the bone and is characterized by local invasion and distant metastasis. Over the past 20 years, long-term outcomes have reached a plateau even with aggressive therapy. Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is associated with tumor proliferation, invasion and migration in osteosarcoma. In the present study, our group developed a novel quinazoline derivative, 6-fluoro-2-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(cyanoanilino)quinazoline (HMJ-30), in order to disrupt IGF-1R signaling and tumor invasiveness in osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells. Molecular modeling, immune-precipitation, western blotting and phosphorylated protein kinase sandwich ELISA assays were used to confirm this hypothesis. The results demonstrated that HMJ-30 selectively targeted the ATP-binding site of IGF-1R and inhibited its downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and IκK/nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways in U-2 OS cells. HMJ-30 inhibited U-2 OS cell invasion and migration and downregulated protein levels and activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. An increase in protein levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 was also observed. Furthermore, HMJ-30 caused U-2 OS cells to aggregate and form tight clusters, and these cells were flattened, less elongated and displayed cobblestone-like shapes. There was an increase in epithelial markers and a decrease in mesenchymal markers, indicating that the cells underwent the reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Overall, these results demonstrated the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of HMJ-30 on invasiveness and EMT in U-2 OS cells, suggesting that this compound deserves further investigation as a potential anti-osteosarcoma drug.},

Three docking programs (Gold, Glide, and Fred) were used to generate poses for a set of 88 protein−ligand complexes for which the crystal structure is known. The new criterion is based on the real space R-factor (RSR), which measures how well a group of atoms−in our case the ligand−fits the experimental electron density by comparing that density to the expected density, calculated from the model (i.e., the predicted ligand pose). The RSR-based measure is compared to the traditional criterion, the root-mean-square distance (RMSD) between the docking pose and the binding configuration in the crystallographic model. The results highlight several shortcomings of the RMSD criterion that do not affect the RSR-based measure. Examples illustrate that the RSR-derived approach allows a more meaningful a posteriori assessment of docking methods and results. Practical implications for docking evaluations and for methodological development work in this field are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Two types of noncovalent bonding interactions are present in protein structures, specific and nonspecific. Nonspecific interactions are mostly hydrophobic and van der Waals. Specific interactions are largely electrostatic. While the hydrophobic effect is the major driving force in protein folding, electrostatic interactions are important in protein folding, stability, flexibility, and function. Here we review the role of close-range electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) and their networks in proteins. Salt bridges are formed by spatially proximal pairs of oppositely charged residues in native protein structures. Often salt-bridging residues are also close in the protein sequence and fall in the same secondary structural element, building block, autonomous folding unit, domain, or subunit, consistent with the hierarchical model for protein folding. Recent evidence also suggests that charged and polar residues in largely hydrophobic interfaces may act as hot spots for binding. Salt bridges are rarely found across protein parts which are joined by flexible hinges, a fact suggesting that salt bridges constrain flexibility and motion. While conventional chemical intuition expects that salt bridges contribute favorably to protein stability, recent computational and experimental evidence shows that salt bridges can be stabilizing or destabilizing. Due to systemic protein flexibility, reflected in small-scale side-chain and backbone atom motions, salt bridges and their stabilities fluctuate in proteins. At the same time, genome-wide, amino acid sequence composition, structural, and thermodynamic comparisons of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins indicate that specific interactions, such as salt bridges, may contribute significantly towards the thermophilic?mesophilic protein stability differential.},

Essentially, each group analyzing these calculations needs to decide how to conduct the analysis and, usually, develop its own analysis tools. Here, we review and recommend best practices for analysis yielding reliable free energies from molecular simulations. Additionally, we provide a Python tool, 
alchemical–analysis.py, freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/choderalab/pymbar–examples, that implements the analysis practices reviewed here for several reference simulation packages, which can be adapted to handle data from other packages. Both this review and the tool covers analysis of alchemical calculations generally, including free energy estimates via both thermodynamic integration and free energy perturbation-based estimators. Our Python tool also handles output from multiple types of free energy calculations, including expanded ensemble and Hamiltonian replica exchange, as well as standard fixed ensemble calculations. We also survey a range of statistical and graphical ways of assessing the quality of the data and free energy estimates, and provide prototypes of these in our tool. We hope these tools and discussion will serve as a foundation for more standardization of and agreement on best practices for analysis of free energy calculations.},

	abstract = {The absolute (standard) binding free energy of eight FK506-related ligands to FKBP12 is calculated using free energy perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations with explicit solvent. A number of features are implemented to improve the accuracy and enhance the convergence of the calculations. First, the absolute binding free energy is decomposed into sequential steps during which the ligand-surrounding interactions as well as various biasing potentials restraining the translation, orientation, and conformation of the ligand are turned "on" and "off." Second, sampling of the ligand conformation is enforced by a restraining potential based on the root mean-square deviation relative to the bound state conformation. The effect of all the restraining potentials is rigorously unbiased, and it is shown explicitly that the final results are independent of all artificial restraints. Third, the repulsive and dispersive free energy contribution arising from the Lennard-Jones interactions of the ligand with its surrounding (protein and solvent) is calculated using the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen separation. This separation also improves convergence of the FEP/MD calculations. Fourth, to decrease the computational cost, only a small number of atoms in the vicinity of the binding site are simulated explicitly, while all the influence of the remaining atoms is incorporated implicitly using the generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP) method. With GSBP, the size of the simulated FKBP12/ligand systems is significantly reduced, from approximately 25,000 to 2500. The computations are very efficient and the statistical error is small ( approximately 1 kcal/mol). The calculated binding free energies are generally in good agreement with available experimental data and previous calculations (within approximately 2 kcal/mol). The present results indicate that a strategy based on FEP/MD simulations of a reduced GSBP atomic model sampled with conformational, translational, and orientational restraining potentials can be computationally inexpensive and accurate.},

	abstract = {The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics (MD) based free energy simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native ligand−receptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in MD simulations, that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost, ΔAr, for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting expression is exact, since all contributions from solute−solvent interactions cancel from the final result. The value of ΔAr depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the chosen harmonic restraint terms and, therefore, can be easily calculated. The standard state dependence of binding free energies is also investigated, and it is shown that the present approach takes this into account correctly. The analytical expression for ΔAr is verified numerically by calculations on the complex formed by benzene with the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a complete binding free energy calculation for a complex based on a simplified model for tyrosine bound to tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed set of restraints and confirm that the calculated binding free energy is independent of the details of the restraints. Comparisons are made with earlier formulations for the calculation of binding free energies, and certain limitations of that work are described. The relationship between ΔAr and the loss of translational and rotational entropy during a binding process is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Accurate in silico prediction of protein–ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.},

For two different situations in which independent observations are simulated from multiple distributions, we show that this likelihood approach achieves the lowest asymptotic variance possible by using estimating equations. In the first situation, the normalizing constants of the design distributions are estimated, and Meng and Wong's bridge sampling estimating equation is considered. In the second situation, the values of the normalizing constants are known, thereby imposing linear constraints on the baseline measure. Estimating equations including Hesterberg's stratified importance sampling estimator, Veach and Guibas's multiple importance sampling estimator, and Owen and Zhou's method of control variates are considered.},

	abstract = {We present a new estimator for computing free energy differences and thermodynamic expectations as well as their uncertainties from samples obtained from multiple equilibrium states via either simulation or experiment. The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

	abstract = {The accurate prediction of the binding affinities of ligands to proteins is a major goal in drug discovery and personalized medicine. The time taken to make such predictions is of similar importance to their accuracy, precision, and reliability. In the past few years, an ensemble based molecular dynamics approach has been proposed that provides a route to reliable predictions of free energies based on the molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area method which meets the requirements of speed, accuracy, precision, and reliability. Here, we describe an equivalent methodology based on thermodynamic integration to substantially improve the speed, accuracy, precision, and reliability of calculated relative binding free energies. We report the performance of the method when applied to a diverse set of protein targets and ligands. The results are in very good agreement with experimental data (90\% of calculations agree to within 1 kcal/mol), while the method is reproducible by construction. Statistical uncertainties of the order of 0.5 kcal/mol or less are achieved. We present a systematic account of how the uncertainty in the predictions may be estimated.},

	abstract = {Although calculations of free energy using molecular dynamics simulations have gained significant importance in the chemical and biochemical fields, they still remain quite computationally intensive. Furthermore, when using thermodynamic integration, numerical evaluation of the integral of the Hamiltonian with respect to the coupling parameter may introduce unwanted errors in the free energy. In this paper, we compare the performance of two numerical integration techniques—the trapezoidal and Simpson’s rules—and propose a new method, based on the analytic integration of physically based fitting functions that are able to accurately describe the behavior of the data. We develop and test our methodology by performing detailed studies on two prototype systems, hydrated methane and hydrated methanol, and treat Lennard-Jones and electrostatic contributions separately. We conclude that the widely used trapezoidal rule may introduce systematic errors in the calculation, but these errors are reduced if Simpson’s rule is employed, at least for the electrostatic component. Furthermore, by fitting thermodynamic integration data, we are able to obtain precise free energy estimates using significantly fewer data points (5 intermediate states for the electrostatic component and 11 for the Lennard-Jones term), thus significantly decreasing the associated computational cost. Our method and improved protocol were successfully validated by computing the free energy of more complex systems—hydration of 2-methylbutanol and of 4-nitrophenol—thus paving the way for widespread use in solvation free energy calculations of drug molecules.},

	abstract = {Abstract MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X.

	abstract = {In calculations of relative free energy differences, the number of atoms of the initial and final states is rarely the same. This necessitates the introduction of dummy atoms. These placeholders interact with the physical system only by bonded energy terms. We investigate the conditions necessary so that the presence of dummy atoms does not influence the result of a relative free energy calculation. On the one hand, one has to ensure that dummy atoms only give a multiplicative contribution to the partition function so that their contribution cancels from double-free energy differences. On the other hand, the bonded terms used to attach a dummy atom (or group of dummy atoms) to the physical system have to maintain it in a well-defined position and orientation relative to the physical system. A detailed theoretical analysis of both aspects is provided, illustrated by 24 calculations of relative solvation free energy differences, for which all four legs of the underlying thermodynamic cycle were computed. Cycle closure (or lack thereof) was used as a sensitive indicator to probing the effects of dummy atom treatment on the resulting free energy differences. We find that a naive (but often practiced) treatment of dummy atoms results in errors of up to kBT when calculating the relative solvation free energy difference between two small solutes, such as methane and ammonia. While our analysis focuses on the so-called single topology approach to set up alchemical transformations, similar considerations apply to dual topology, at least many widely used variants thereof.},

The parametrization philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present paper in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it possible to perform “all-CHARMM” simulations on drug-target interactions thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant systems.},
