  abstract = {In calculations of relative free energy differences, the number of atoms of the initial and final states is rarely the same. This necessitates the introduction of dummy atoms. These placeholders interact with the physical system only by bonded energy terms. We investigate the conditions necessary so that the presence of dummy atoms does not influence the result of a relative free energy calculation. On the one hand, one has to ensure that dummy atoms only give a multiplicative contribution to the partition function so that their contribution cancels from double-free energy differences. On the other hand, the bonded terms used to attach a dummy atom (or group of dummy atoms) to the physical system have to maintain it in a well-defined position and orientation relative to the physical system. A detailed theoretical analysis of both aspects is provided, illustrated by 24 calculations of relative solvation free energy differences, for which all four legs of the underlying thermodynamic cycle were computed. Cycle closure (or lack thereof) was used as a sensitive indicator to probing the effects of dummy atom treatment on the resulting free energy differences. We find that a naive (but often practiced) treatment of dummy atoms results in errors of up to kBT when calculating the relative solvation free energy difference between two small solutes, such as methane and ammonia. While our analysis focuses on the so-called single topology approach to set up alchemical transformations, similar considerations apply to dual topology, at least many widely used variants thereof.},

abstract = {Abstract MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X.
